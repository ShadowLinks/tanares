Will you embrace the power and influence that come with your position, or will you question the motives of those in power and fight against the injustices of the Empire? Will you use your position for the greater good, or will you succumb to the corrupting influence of power?</p>

            <h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
            <p>Living under the rule of the Empire was a challenging and often brutal experience, and those who served it are no exception. These individuals ranged from capable and loyal servants to ruthless officials who would do whatever it took to maintain their power and influence. While many drifted away from the Empire after its fall, you still maintain deep roots from years of obedience that are not easily pruned. As a result, you may be prone to maintaining loyalty to the Empire even after it has lost its former glory, or perhaps you harbor feelings of resentment for the role it played in your life. You may have an acute sense of duty and honor, or a ruthless streak that allows you to achieve your goalsby any means necessary. Whatever your disposition, your time as an Imperial servant has left an indelible mark on your character that will shape your decisions and actions for years to come.</p>

            <p>Your years of service to the Empire allowed you to build a vast network of contacts still working within its various departments. You have at least one ally in each department who can help you obtain meetings, information, or simple items such as an insignia or official document (with no gp value and not magical) like a pass to enter the Empire. These old friends may owe you a favor, or you may owe them one, but the relationship is mutually beneficial and can prove valuable in a variety of situations.</p>
