            <p>Dragonblades trained in the Soul of the White Dragon are the sentinels of the frozen tundra, their bodies honed to withstand the freezing winds of the North. They are the guardians of sacred places, their forms standing like bastions of ice and steel against all who would dare threaten the Draconic Council’s interests.</p>
            <p class="indent">Embodying the resilience and cunning of the white dragon, these warriors venture deep into the heart of the frosty wilds, braving blizzards that rage like a tempest, scaling icy cliffs as if they were steps to the heavens. Every step they take is a testament to their unwavering determination, every breath a reminder of their fierce loyalty.</p>
            <p class="indent">With each battle, they hone their bodies to be more attuned to the ways of the white dragon, drawing upon its mastery of the environment to survive where others would perish. Their movements are graceful, yet deadly, like the flow of ice upon a frozen river. They are the protectors of dragon lairs, their eyes constantly scanning the horizon, their senses alert for any sign of danger.</p>
            <p class="indent">The sight of a Dragonblade trained in the Soul of the White Dragon is both fearsome and awe-inspiring. Their determination shines like diamonds in the snow, their resolve shields its allies in the bleakest of environments. These warriors are the guardians of the Draconic Council, their unwavering spirit a reminder that even in the face of the coldest winter, the fire of protection and defense burns bright.</p>
