            <p>The downfall of Arcana marked the end of an era for magic, but the knowledge and power of the arcane still lies hidden in dungeons and ruins across Tanares. The Lost Magic Researchers are wizards who have dedicated themselves to uncovering the secrets of the ancient mages, who once wielded magic with greater proficiency and potency.</p>
            <p class="indent">These wizards boast a deep understanding of the arcane and have developed unique methods for augmenting their magic to levels beyond what is seen in the present day. They are also physically fit, a testament to their adventurous spirit and fearless pursuit of knowledge, as they delve into dungeons, climb down treacherous tunnels, and excavate long-forgotten ruins to uncover the secrets of the arcane.</p>
            <p class="indent">Lost Magic Researchers are adventurers at heart, driven by a thirst for discovery and a fearless spirit. They are not content to simply hone their craft within the safety of their towers, but instead brave dangers to seek out the knowledge of the past. Whether they are treasure hunters, archaeologists, cartographers, or even mercenaries, these wizards are united by their unwavering determination to unlock the secrets of the arcane.</p>

            <p>From the 2nd level, you can use a bonus action to amplify the effects of your spells. When casting a spell of 1st level or higher, you can make an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC of 17 + the spell’s level. It cannot benefit from the Help action. Depending on your roll’s result, apply the effects described in the table below to your spell.</p>

            <p>At 14th level, your quest for mystical artifacts has sharpened your ability to detect relics, objects, traps, and the flow of magical energy.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can sense any magic within a 90-foot radius, whether present in a magic item, artifact, creature, or location affected by magic. With an action, you can identify the nature of the magic, its level, and its school of magic, if applicable.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the source of the magic is an item or artifact, touching it will reveal its properties, usage methods, potential dangers, and any attunement requirements. You can also determine if the item was crafted through magic and the nature of that magic.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the magic source is a creature, touching it reveals the magic affecting it, its effects, and at the GM’s discretion, the steps required to remove it.</p>
