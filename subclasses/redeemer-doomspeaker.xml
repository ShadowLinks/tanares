            <p>Chosen by Bauron in their dreams, even if not aware of it, redeemers of the Doomspeaker vocation strive to ready mortals for the inevitable armageddon. Tasked with fortifying society against the Ungods’ invasion, they establish institutions, build armies, and manipulate the masses for the ultimate battle in the Penumbral Plane. Exceptional strategists and businessmen, Doomspeakers amass resources and wealth to construct a resilient society able to withstand the Ungods’ onslaught. Often found in influential positions, such as traders, politicians, or religious leaders, their primary goal is to consolidate power and resources, ensuring the world stands prepared for the impending threat.</p>
