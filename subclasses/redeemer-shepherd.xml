            <p>Redeemers who follow the Shepherd vocation are those whose mission given by Tamera in their dreams, even if they are not aware of it, is to bring balance and soothe the masses so that their emotions do not generate penumbral creatures. In addition, controlling the emotions of the masses ensures that wars are less likely to happen. Shepherds are excellent leaders of crowds, often religious leaders, prophets, and healers.</p>

            <p>At 2nd level, you receive a special marking on your character sheet called the Cycle of Redemption. The position to which you move the marker on the Cycle, when you use one of your rays, will guarantee you a unique benefit, which will last until the beginning of your next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent">After taking a long rest, you determine your starting position on the Cycle and then place a marker on your character sheet in the chosen position. You move this marker every time you declare firing one of your Rays. The position you will be in at the end of this move will determine the benefit you will receive until the beginning of your next turn. You do not receive any benefits if you did not use your action to perform a ray in your turn.</p>
            <p class="indent">The movement happens before the ray is shot, so all benefits to moving in a new position are applied before the ray is used. This movement still happens if you are using Magic in Rays, and is also applied before the spell is cast.</p>
