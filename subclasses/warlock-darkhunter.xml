        <description>
            <p>You made a pact with an obscure otherworldly entity that refuses to reveal its true origin, sharing with you only its goal: to destroy all aberrations and unnatural creatures that plague the multiverse. It desires you to act as its hand in your world, eradicating the dark beings hidden in the shadows.</p>
            <p class="indent">Different from other warlocks you train your body and mind to exhaustion to fight the creatures of darkness. You learn how to properly use all kinds of weapons to deliver your powerful magic abilities, channeling your powers through blades and bolts alike, becoming the terror of all dark beings.</p>
            <p class="indent">Moved by vengeance, a strange sense of justice, or some other personal goal, your path is often dark, grim, and solitary. One that most common folk would never have the guts to take, but that is the reason most warloks of the Dark Hunter choose this path.</p>
            <p class="indent">The Dark Hunter lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.</p>

            <p>Starting at 1st level, your mystical abilities become more potent against the unnatural creatures you are called to hunt. When you hit with a weapon attack against an aberration, undead, or a creature not native to the Material Plane, deal an additional 1d6 damage. This extra damage bypasses any resistance or immunity. This damage increases to 1d8 at 9th level, and to 1d10 at 17th level.</p>

            <p>At 1st level, you master the skills necessary for your mission. You gain proficiency with Perception and Stealth skills, as well as shields and martial weapons. Your patron grants you the ability to channel your magic through any weapon you wield. You may use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for attack and damage rolls when wielding a weapon.</p>
            <p class="indent">In addition, you may apply any invocations that produce an effect or additional damage upon a hit with an Eldritch Blast to your weapon attacks. This does not allow the use of invocations altering attack range or area.</p>

            <p>At 14th level, you gain the ability to sense the presence of unnatural creatures. You are always aware if any aberration, undead, or a creature not native to the Material Plane is within 60 feet of you, even if the creature is hidden.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can discern the direction and number of such creatures, as well as their general appearance, but you glean no further information. This ability doesn’t grant you sight of these entities, but rather, an intuition of their presence.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you slay one of these creatures, all others within 60 feet of you that can see you must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, they become frightened for 1 minute. Creatures immune to fear effects are not immune to this effect if they have an Intelligence score of 3 or higher.</p>
