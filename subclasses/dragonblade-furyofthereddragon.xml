            <p>Dragonblades are the shock troops of the Draconic Council, and the Fury of the Red Dragon is one of the most aggressive and intense training styles within their ranks. These warriors are forged by dragon fire in the art of war and are trained to lead the assault against their enemies. Those who choose this path are experts in battle, and their relentless aggression is unmatched. Whether it be scorching heat or raging infernos, the Fury of the Red Dragon dragonblades are capable of withstanding the harshest scorching conditions, making them ideal for missions in South Tanares. They seek to study the ways of the red dragon and learn from their mastery of the environment. These warriors are the embodiment of dragon-like ferocity, and they are feared and respected by friends and foes alike.</p>

            <p>At 2nd level, you can channel a portion of your Empowered Soul energy to unleash your fiery fury. Each time your soul becomes Empowered by Draconic Power, you can immediately release fire on a creature you can see within a 30-feet radius. Make a ranged attack roll against it; if you hit, the creature takes 1d6 fire damage for every two Dragonblade levels you possess, rounded down.</p>
