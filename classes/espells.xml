            <p>You create a gaseous copy of yourself in an empty space beside you. This copy is indistinguishable from you, even by magical means or abilities such as true sight. The copy has the same stats as you, except for its hit points, as the copy disappears and the spell immediately ends if it takes any damage. The copy has its own turn, which can be immediately before or after your turn. You command what it does (actions, bonus actions, reactions, movement, etc.). It has no resources of its own, such as ammunition, ability uses, or spell slots, so every time it uses something that costs a resource, it uses the resources that you have. For example, if the copy casts a spell, it consumes one of your spell slots as though you had cast the spell yourself. The same principle applies to the use of potions, scrolls, and similar items. </p>
            <p class="indent">When you are targeted by an attack, spell, or ability that would damage you, you can instantly switch positions with the copy, which must be within 120 feet of you, so it takes the damage and other effects in your place, causing this spell to end automatically. If the damage dealt to the copy comes from a melee attack, the attacker must make a Wisdom saving throw, becoming stunned for 1 minute on a failure. A creature stunned in this way can make the save again at the end of each of its turns, ending the condition on a success. You and your copy cannot be more than 120 feet apart, if that happens the spell ends automatically and the copy disappears.</p>

            <p>As you cast the spell, the gem used as a material component is consumed to bring visions of the target’s ancestors, blending them with the target’s memories and unlocking new potential within the individual. However, some of the target’s memories are lost in the process. The target may choose to change any or all of their subclass, feats, or features, provided they meet the prerequisites for the chosen options. Certain abilities that require additional resources, such as gold, experience points, or training, cannot be chosen unless the target possesses the necessary resources at the time of casting.</p>
            <p class="indent">Once the spell is complete, the chosen options are permanent, and they cannot be altered by this spell or similar effects again. The GM may impose restrictions or penalties to reflect the significant impact of the decision.</p>

            <p class="indent">The plates are perfect squares and can be placed in any position (horizontal or vertical). Any adjacent slabs merge with each other, and each plate can act as a foundation for another, allowing for continuous constructions in any direction, such as bridges or ramps, as long as at least one of the plates is anchored to the earth to be stable.</p>
            <p class="indent">A plate cannot occupy the space of a creature or object. If a plate appears in a location occupied by a creature, it is pushed to any side of your choice.

            <p class="indent">Each plate has an AC of 16 and 180 hit points, disappearing magically if reduced to 0, possibly causing the collapse of adjacent plates at the GM’s discretion.</p>
            <p class="indent">As a bonus action, you can dispense the plates at any time during the spell. If you maintain concentration for the entire duration of the spell, you can choose to keep the plates permanently, but they will turn into plates of slightly greenish rock, without any value other than stone.

            <p>When you cast this spell, a flame that rises from your feet covers your entire body, increasing your speed and strength momentarily. As part of this spell, you can immediately move 40 feet in any direction you choose. During this movement, you can push objects up to five times your normal capacity (or 150 times your Strength score in pounds). If you collide with a creature, the movement ends, and the creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 40 feet back and fall prone. If the creature’s movement is interrupted by obstacles, it will fall prone and suffer 4d6 bludgeoning damage in addition. If the path is blocked by another creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, suffering the same damage and falling prone on a failure.</p>

            <p>You touch a creature, and that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become cursed for the duration of the spell. The cursed creature feels terrible pain as if it were being burned. Every time you deal damage to the cursed creature, it takes an extra 1d6 fire damage. Additionally, at the start of its turns, the cursed creature must make a Constitution saving throw, and on a failure, the creature feels intense pain and wastes its action of that turn doing nothing.</p>
            <p class="indent">At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. If you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration is 8 hours. If you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is 24 hours. If you use a 9th level spell slot, the spell lasts until it is dispelled. Using a spell slot of 5th level or higher grants a duration that doesn’t require concentration.</p>

            <p>When you touch a silk scarf to a wall of rock or earth, you create a shelter for up to eight people. The entrance marked by the scarf can only be seen by those you designate and is invisible to others. Inside the shelter it is dry, has a comfortable climate, and a small crystal provides illumination that can be turned on or off with a word from anyone chosen. At the end of the spell, you can cast it again to maintain the same shelter, otherwise the spell ends. You can use an action to end the spell at any time, and when the spell ends, the void created fills and expels anything inside it out of the wall. The volume of rock in the wall must be compatible with the size of the shelter created, otherwise the spell fails.</p>
            <p class="indent">Elemental Flux. You can imbue your elemental flow into the entrance, so that once during the duration of the spell, when an undesired person enters the earth shelter, they must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 5d6 acid damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one.</p>

            <p>You commune with the element of air, and it answers your call. You can determine how the winds of up to 5 miles will behave, accelerating or stopping them. Each round that you accelerate or stop the winds, the winds in the area increase or decrease one stage on the Wind table:</p>

            <p class="indent">In addition, as a bonus action, you can cause a strong gust of wind to arise in a direction of your choosing, affecting a 120 square feet area. Any creatures that start their turn or enter the area must make a Strength saving throw or be pushed 40 feet in the direction of the wind and be knocked prone. A creature whose movement is impeded by obstructed spaces, such as walls or objects two size categories larger, takes 1d6 damage for every 10 feet it moved before having its movement impeded. If you choose to have the wind blow against the ground or a creature that cannot move due to a wall or other obstructed space caused by large or larger objects, a creature that fails the saving throw is knocked prone and restrained until the beginning of its next turn.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You manipulate the earth, opening a fissure within range, starting at a point you can see. The fissure occupies a line 50 feet long and 10 feet wide. Within the line, a chasm opens up to a depth of 20 feet, and creatures within the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they fall into the chasm. The terrain inside the fissure is considered difficult, and its walls are sandy, making any Strength (Athletics) check to climb it to be rolled against your Spell Save DC</p>
            <p class="indent">Starting at your next turn, you can close the fissure as an action. Creatures still inside it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 6d12 force damage on a failure, or half as much on a success. Until the start of your next turn after closing the fissure, it is not fully sealed, and a creature trapped inside the fissure has total cover but is restrained and can use their action to make a Strength saving throw. On a success, they can use their full movement to try to climb out, ending the condition when they leave the fissure, but for every 1 foot of movement required, they must spend an additional 1 foot, emerging in an adjacent space to the fissure if the movement is sufficient. On a failure, they cannot move. At the start of the next turn after the fissure is closed, it is fully sealed, and all creatures still inside it are incapacitated and have their movement reduced to 0. Creatures with burrowing movement are immune to the effects of closing the fissure. The fissure closes automatically at the end of the spell or if you lose concentration.</p>
            <p class="indent">Elemental Flux. With your next elemental surge, you stomp the ground. All creatures in a 20-foot radius circle centered on you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 10d6 bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.</p>

            <p>You ignite your spirit with flames, emitting an aura that generates adoration or fear in a specific type of creature around you. You choose a type of intelligent creature as the target of this spell, and all of those within range are affected according to the chosen aura as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent">Frightful Aura. This aura causes the chosen creatures within range to feel fear. Each creature of the chosen type that starts its turn or enters the aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for the duration of the spell. A creature that succeeds the saving throw is immune to the effect for 1 minute. While frightened, the creature uses its movement to reach the safest place possible where it cannot see you and is out of range. When it is out of range and can no longer see you, the creature is no longer frightened. If the creature re-enters the range or can see you again, it becomes frightened once more. Whenever a creature takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>
            <p class="indent">Adoration Aura. This aura causes all chosen creatures within range to adore you as a revered entity. Each creature of the chosen type that starts its turn or enters the aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the spell’s duration. A creature that succeeds the saving throw is immune to the effect for 1 minute. A charmed creature approaches you as closely as possible and will adore you in the best way its culture or customs would venerate a figure of respect, as determined by the GM. Whenever a creature can no longer see you and is more than 60 feet awayfrom you, it is free from the effect, but will become affected again if it sees you or is within 60 feet of you once more. If a creature takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>

            <p>All creatures you choose within the spell’s range and that can see you must make a Charisma saving throw. A target automatically succeeds the saving throw if it is immune to the frightened condition. On a failure, the target is affected by the spell. Until the end of the spell’s duration, you can, as a bonus action, specify a location that is not occupied by a creature where the creatures will believe that blazing flames are erupting, emitting extreme heat. At the start of their turns, each affected target within 30 feet of the chosen point must move away from the heat source at all its speed before taking any other actions. A creature that is forced to move by this effect may repeat the saving throw at the end of its turn, freeing itself from the effect on a success. A creature that does not move for any reason remains frightened until it moves away. A creature will not walk to a location that is obviously a mortal danger, such as a cliff, but it may provoke opportunity attacks during its movements.</p>

            <p>You focus the energy of an area spell or effect that deals damage onto a single creature of your choice that was originally targeted by that spell or effect. The chosen creature must be within range of the spell or effect, and you must have a clear line of sight to it.</p>
            <p class="indent">The chosen creature takes an additional 1d6 damage of the same type as the original spell or effect, and the DC of any saving throws it makes against the spell or effect increases by 2.</p>
            <p class="indent">For example, if a fireball is about to detonate in a 20-foot radius around you and other creatures, you can use focused blast to redirect the full force of the fireball only to that creature. The target makes its saving throw as usual, but the original DC is increased by 2. If it fails, it takes an additional 1d6 of fire damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">You must have a clear line of sight to both the caster and the chosen creature. If you do not have a clear line of sight to either of these, the spell fails. This spell does not allow you to target a creature that was not in the original affected area.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 5-foot cube. This image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. Only one chosen creature can sense this image and it seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can’t create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature.</p>
            <p class="indent">As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.</p>
            <p class="indent">Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.</p>
            <p class="indent">At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring your concentration.</p>
            <p class="indent">Elemental Flux. Your next elemental surge deals 2d6 thunder damage plus 1d6 thunder damage for each slot level above 2nd.</p>

Each creature that starts its turn in the line must make a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet in the direction of the wind and be knocked prone.

You heal 4d8 hit points, which you can distribute as you see fit among the creatures in the area (minimum of 0 hit points per creature). This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.</p>
            <p class="indent">All creatures within the area of the spell become wet as if they have been bathed with 3 gallons of water.</p>
            <p class="indent">At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>
            <p class="indent">Elemental Flux. Your next elemental surge deals 5d6 cold damage plus 1d6 cold damage for each slot level above 3rd.</p>

            <p>Upon casting this spell, your eyes glow with an eerie light. At the start of each of your turns, you may choose any number of creatures you can see. Each one must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you. A creature frightened in this way must use its actions to move as far away from you as possible via the safest available route, unless it can’t move. If it moves to a spot that is at least 60 feet away from you, it is no longer frightened. If the creature can’t move, it must make another Wisdom saving throw at the end of its turn. On a failed save, it falls unconscious until it takes damage or until someone uses an action to awake it. A creature that was already frightened by this spell and is targeted again, it makes the saving throw with advantage.</p>

            <p>You carefully create a powerful glyph on a surface, which can be a wall, table, throne, book cover, shield, etc., as long as it has a surface area of 1 foot in diameter.

A creature that touches the object or is in the area being disintegrated must make a Constitution saving throw, reducing its hit points to 0 and turning to dust on a failure or taking 6d8 radiant damage and 6d8 fire damage on a success.</p>
            <p class="indent">Self-Destruction. The glyph self-destructs in a powerful explosion. All creatures within a 60-foot radius must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 40d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
            <p class="indent">Eternal Heat. The glyph emits a lot of heat. For the next 1001 days, any creature that starts its turn or enters a space within 30 feet of the glyph takes 4d8 fire damage, and creatures that are beyond these 30 feet but within 60 feet of the  glyph must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 2d8 fire damage on a failure.</p>

            <p>You purify the body of a dead creature with sacred waters, resurrecting the creature. The creature cannot have been dead for more than 10 days and revives with 1 hit point, free of any curses or conditions (except for exhaustion, which only recovers 1 level) that affected it at the time of its death. This spell does not restore lost parts and does not affect undead or constructs, or creatures whose soul does not want to resurrect, or creatures that have died from old age.</p>
            <p class="indent">Elemental Flux. You can imbue your next elemental surge into the revived creature, which gains 5d8 temporary hit points lasting for 8 hours.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You forge a powerful connection between two willing creatures of your choice within range, causing them to instantly swap their current hit points and maximum hit points. If a creature’s hit points drop to 0 as a result of the swap, that creature falls unconscious and begins dying.</p>
            <p class="indent">In addition to the hit point swap, the two creatures can choose to exchange any of the following effects, provided both creatures agree:</p>
            <p class="indent">Condition Swap. Choose one of the following conditions: blinded, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned, or stunned. If one of the creatures is currently affected by the chosen condition, that creature is cured of the condition and the other creature becomes affected by it. This exchange lasts until the spell ends, at which point the conditions return to the originally affected creature.</p>
            <p class="indent">Skill Swap. The two creatures choose one skill, tool, or language proficiency each and exchange the chosen proficiency for the duration of the spell.</p>
            <p class="indent">At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration of the condition swap and skill swap increases by 1 extra hour for each slot level above 3rd.</p>
            <p class="indent">Elemental Flux. If used for the duration of the spell, but before any other spell is cast, your next elemental surge deals 5d6 cold damage or grants 5d6 temporary hit points to creatures of your choice within the area of effect.</p>
