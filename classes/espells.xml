            <p>You create a gaseous copy of yourself in an empty space beside you. This copy is indistinguishable from you, even by magical means or abilities such as true sight. The copy has the same stats as you, except for its hit points, as the copy disappears and the spell immediately ends if it takes any damage. The copy has its own turn, which can be immediately before or after your turn. You command what it does (actions, bonus actions, reactions, movement, etc.). It has no resources of its own, such as ammunition, ability uses, or spell slots, so every time it uses something that costs a resource, it uses the resources that you have. For example, if the copy casts a spell, it consumes one of your spell slots as though you had cast the spell yourself. The same principle applies to the use of potions, scrolls, and similar items. </p>
            <p class="indent">When you are targeted by an attack, spell, or ability that would damage you, you can instantly switch positions with the copy, which must be within 120 feet of you, so it takes the damage and other effects in your place, causing this spell to end automatically. If the damage dealt to the copy comes from a melee attack, the attacker must make a Wisdom saving throw, becoming stunned for 1 minute on a failure. A creature stunned in this way can make the save again at the end of each of its turns, ending the condition on a success. You and your copy cannot be more than 120 feet apart, if that happens the spell ends automatically and the copy disappears.</p>

            <p>As you cast the spell, the gem used as a material component is consumed to bring visions of the target’s ancestors, blending them with the target’s memories and unlocking new potential within the individual. However, some of the target’s memories are lost in the process. The target may choose to change any or all of their subclass, feats, or features, provided they meet the prerequisites for the chosen options. Certain abilities that require additional resources, such as gold, experience points, or training, cannot be chosen unless the target possesses the necessary resources at the time of casting.</p>
            <p class="indent">Once the spell is complete, the chosen options are permanent, and they cannot be altered by this spell or similar effects again. The GM may impose restrictions or penalties to reflect the significant impact of the decision.</p>

            <p class="indent">The plates are perfect squares and can be placed in any position (horizontal or vertical). Any adjacent slabs merge with each other, and each plate can act as a foundation for another, allowing for continuous constructions in any direction, such as bridges or ramps, as long as at least one of the plates is anchored to the earth to be stable.</p>
            <p class="indent">A plate cannot occupy the space of a creature or object. If a plate appears in a location occupied by a creature, it is pushed to any side of your choice.

            <p class="indent">Each plate has an AC of 16 and 180 hit points, disappearing magically if reduced to 0, possibly causing the collapse of adjacent plates at the GM’s discretion.</p>
            <p class="indent">As a bonus action, you can dispense the plates at any time during the spell. If you maintain concentration for the entire duration of the spell, you can choose to keep the plates permanently, but they will turn into plates of slightly greenish rock, without any value other than stone.

            <p>You manifest a series of flowers in the space you occupy, which immediately grow and bloom, releasing their pollen in a circular area with a 20-foot radius centered on you. Any charm or frightening effect affecting a creature in the area ends immediately. Additionally, any creature hostile towards you or your allies within the area must make a Charisma saving throw, and on a failure, they become indifferent to you and your allies until the end of the spell or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it.</p>

            <p>When you cast this spell, a flame that rises from your feet covers your entire body, increasing your speed and strength momentarily. As part of this spell, you can immediately move 40 feet in any direction you choose. During this movement, you can push objects up to five times your normal capacity (or 150 times your Strength score in pounds). If you collide with a creature, the movement ends, and the creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 40 feet back and fall prone. If the creature’s movement is interrupted by obstacles, it will fall prone and suffer 4d6 bludgeoning damage in addition. If the path is blocked by another creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, suffering the same damage and falling prone on a failure.</p>
            <p class="indent">Elemental Flux. Your next elemental surge affects a 20-foot radius sphere centered on you and deals 10d6 fire damage.</p>

As long as they are within 1 mile of you, each of these creatures can be teleported from their locations to an unoccupied space closest to you.

            <p>You fill your mind with the calm that only water can achieve. For the duration, you become immune to psychic damage, any effect that may sense emotions or read thoughts, divination spells and the charmed and frightened conditions. Optionally, you can transform the effect into an aura, affecting willing creatures of your choice within 20 feet of you, but you must concentrate to maintain the spell in this way. In this option, the spell will last only until the start of your next turn, ending sooner if you lose concentration.</p>
