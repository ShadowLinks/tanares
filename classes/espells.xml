            <p>You create a gaseous copy of yourself in an empty space beside you. This copy is indistinguishable from you, even by magical means or abilities such as true sight. The copy has the same stats as you, except for its hit points, as the copy disappears and the spell immediately ends if it takes any damage. The copy has its own turn, which can be immediately before or after your turn. You command what it does (actions, bonus actions, reactions, movement, etc.). It has no resources of its own, such as ammunition, ability uses, or spell slots, so every time it uses something that costs a resource, it uses the resources that you have. For example, if the copy casts a spell, it consumes one of your spell slots as though you had cast the spell yourself. The same principle applies to the use of potions, scrolls, and similar items. </p>
            <p class="indent">When you are targeted by an attack, spell, or ability that would damage you, you can instantly switch positions with the copy, which must be within 120 feet of you, so it takes the damage and other effects in your place, causing this spell to end automatically. If the damage dealt to the copy comes from a melee attack, the attacker must make a Wisdom saving throw, becoming stunned for 1 minute on a failure. A creature stunned in this way can make the save again at the end of each of its turns, ending the condition on a success. You and your copy cannot be more than 120 feet apart, if that happens the spell ends automatically and the copy disappears.</p>

            <p>As you cast the spell, the gem used as a material component is consumed to bring visions of the target’s ancestors, blending them with the target’s memories and unlocking new potential within the individual. However, some of the target’s memories are lost in the process. The target may choose to change any or all of their subclass, feats, or features, provided they meet the prerequisites for the chosen options. Certain abilities that require additional resources, such as gold, experience points, or training, cannot be chosen unless the target possesses the necessary resources at the time of casting.</p>
            <p class="indent">Once the spell is complete, the chosen options are permanent, and they cannot be altered by this spell or similar effects again. The GM may impose restrictions or penalties to reflect the significant impact of the decision.</p>

            <p class="indent">The plates are perfect squares and can be placed in any position (horizontal or vertical). Any adjacent slabs merge with each other, and each plate can act as a foundation for another, allowing for continuous constructions in any direction, such as bridges or ramps, as long as at least one of the plates is anchored to the earth to be stable.</p>
            <p class="indent">A plate cannot occupy the space of a creature or object. If a plate appears in a location occupied by a creature, it is pushed to any side of your choice.

            <p class="indent">Each plate has an AC of 16 and 180 hit points, disappearing magically if reduced to 0, possibly causing the collapse of adjacent plates at the GM’s discretion.</p>
            <p class="indent">As a bonus action, you can dispense the plates at any time during the spell. If you maintain concentration for the entire duration of the spell, you can choose to keep the plates permanently, but they will turn into plates of slightly greenish rock, without any value other than stone.

            <p>When you cast this spell, a flame that rises from your feet covers your entire body, increasing your speed and strength momentarily. As part of this spell, you can immediately move 40 feet in any direction you choose. During this movement, you can push objects up to five times your normal capacity (or 150 times your Strength score in pounds). If you collide with a creature, the movement ends, and the creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 40 feet back and fall prone. If the creature’s movement is interrupted by obstacles, it will fall prone and suffer 4d6 bludgeoning damage in addition. If the path is blocked by another creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, suffering the same damage and falling prone on a failure.</p>

            <p>You touch a creature, and that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become cursed for the duration of the spell. The cursed creature feels terrible pain as if it were being burned. Every time you deal damage to the cursed creature, it takes an extra 1d6 fire damage. Additionally, at the start of its turns, the cursed creature must make a Constitution saving throw, and on a failure, the creature feels intense pain and wastes its action of that turn doing nothing.</p>
            <p class="indent">At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. If you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration is 8 hours. If you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is 24 hours. If you use a 9th level spell slot, the spell lasts until it is dispelled. Using a spell slot of 5th level or higher grants a duration that doesn’t require concentration.</p>

            <p>When you touch a silk scarf to a wall of rock or earth, you create a shelter for up to eight people. The entrance marked by the scarf can only be seen by those you designate and is invisible to others. Inside the shelter it is dry, has a comfortable climate, and a small crystal provides illumination that can be turned on or off with a word from anyone chosen. At the end of the spell, you can cast it again to maintain the same shelter, otherwise the spell ends. You can use an action to end the spell at any time, and when the spell ends, the void created fills and expels anything inside it out of the wall. The volume of rock in the wall must be compatible with the size of the shelter created, otherwise the spell fails.</p>
            <p class="indent">Elemental Flux. You can imbue your elemental flow into the entrance, so that once during the duration of the spell, when an undesired person enters the earth shelter, they must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 5d6 acid damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one.</p>

            <p>You commune with the element of air, and it answers your call. You can determine how the winds of up to 5 miles will behave, accelerating or stopping them. Each round that you accelerate or stop the winds, the winds in the area increase or decrease one stage on the Wind table:</p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr><td>Wind Stage</td><td>Condition</td></tr>
                </thead>
                <tr><td>1</td><td>Calm</td></tr>
                <tr><td>2</td><td>Moderate wind</td></tr>
                <tr><td>3</td><td>Strong wind</td></tr>
                <tr><td>4</td><td>Gale</td></tr>
                <tr><td>5</td><td>Storm</td></tr>
            </table>
            <p class="indent">In addition, as a bonus action, you can cause a strong gust of wind to arise in a direction of your choosing, affecting a 120 square feet area. Any creatures that start their turn or enter the area must make a Strength saving throw or be pushed 40 feet in the direction of the wind and be knocked prone. A creature whose movement is impeded by obstructed spaces, such as walls or objects two size categories larger, takes 1d6 damage for every 10 feet it moved before having its movement impeded. If you choose to have the wind blow against the ground or a creature that cannot move due to a wall or other obstructed space caused by large or larger objects, a creature that fails the saving throw is knocked prone and restrained until the beginning of its next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent">Elemental Flux. You make Your next Elemental Surge burst around you, which affects a 30-foot radius circle centered on you and deals 12d6 thunder damage.</p>

            <p>You ignite the flames of rage in a creature you can see within range, forcing the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, for the duration of the spell, the creature becomes frenzied and will always attack its nearest creature. If there are no creatures within reach, the affected creature will spend its entire turn moving to the nearest creature. The affected creature is also immune to frightened and charmed and cannot use spells or any spellcasting abilities, only making armed and unarmed attacks. Additionally, all of its attack rolls will have advantage, but all attack rolls against the affected creature will also have advantage.</p>
            <p class="indent">The affected creature can make a new saving throw at the beginning of all its turns to break free of the effect on a success. If it has taken any damage since the end of its last turn, it will make the save with disadvantage.</p>

            <p>You connect your essence with that of the air. For the duration, your movement speed is doubled, you have advantage on any Dexterity checks, and you don’t provoke opportunity attacks for moving.</p>
            <p class="indent">In addition, when a creature makes an attack against you, you can use your reaction to dissipate into the air and avoid the attack. While dissipated, you are immune to all damage. At the start of your next turn, you rematerialize in any unoccupied space within 120 feet of the initial point. Creatures of your choice within 5 feet must make a Constitution saving throw, being moved 5 feet and incapacitated for 1 minute on a failure.</p>

            <p>You cast this spell and begin to dance, affecting an area of 30ft around you. You can choose a number of creatures equal to your Wisdom modifier to be immune to the effects of this spell, while all other creatures that start their turn or enter the area and can see you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, they are charmed. A creature charmed by this spell begins to replicate your dance.</p>
            <p class="indent">While you use your action to dance, all charmed creatures dance along with you, losing their actions. If you move, the creatures move with you in the best way they can, expending their movement on their next turn. A creature that is more than 60 feet away from you, or who fails to see you for two turns or takes damage, is freed from the spell’s effects.</p>
