            <p>You attempt to disrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell, converting its magical power into healing droplets. If the spell being cast is 5th level or lower, it fails and has no effect. If it is 6th level or higher, you must make a spellcasting ability check. The DC equals 10 plus the level of the spell being cast. On a successful check, the spell fails.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the target’s spell fails, you can choose to absorb the energy from the interrupted spell, gaining temporary hit points equal to the spell’s level that lasts for 1 minute, or copy it, casting the spell immediately as if you were the original caster, and without requiring any material components.</p>

            <p>You create a gaseous copy of yourself in an empty space beside you. This copy is indistinguishable from you, even by magical means or abilities such as true sight. The copy has the same stats as you, except for its hit points, as the copy disappears and the spell immediately ends if it takes any damage. The copy has its own turn, which can be immediately before or after your turn. You command what it does (actions, bonus actions, reactions, movement, etc.). It has no resources of its own, such as ammunition, ability uses, or spell slots, so every time it uses something that costs a resource, it uses the resources that you have. For example, if the copy casts a spell, it consumes one of your spell slots as though you had cast the spell yourself. The same principle applies to the use of potions, scrolls, and similar items. </p>
            <p class="indent">When you are targeted by an attack, spell, or ability that would damage you, you can instantly switch positions with the copy, which must be within 120 feet of you, so it takes the damage and other effects in your place, causing this spell to end automatically. If the damage dealt to the copy comes from a melee attack, the attacker must make a Wisdom saving throw, becoming stunned for 1 minute on a failure. A creature stunned in this way can make the save again at the end of each of its turns, ending the condition on a success. You and your copy cannot be more than 120 feet apart, if that happens the spell ends automatically and the copy disappears.</p>

            <p>As you cast the spell, the gem used as a material component is consumed to bring visions of the target’s ancestors, blending them with the target’s memories and unlocking new potential within the individual. However, some of the target’s memories are lost in the process. The target may choose to change any or all of their subclass, feats, or features, provided they meet the prerequisites for the chosen options. Certain abilities that require additional resources, such as gold, experience points, or training, cannot be chosen unless the target possesses the necessary resources at the time of casting.</p>
            <p class="indent">Once the spell is complete, the chosen options are permanent, and they cannot be altered by this spell or similar effects again. The GM may impose restrictions or penalties to reflect the significant impact of the decision.</p>
            <p class="indent">Elemental Flux. Your next elemental surge can create a thin layer of water around the creature, granting it 9d6 temporary hit points for 10 minutes.</p>

            <p>You create eight plates of pure beryl at points within range of the spell. Each beryl plate is 6 inches thick and 10 feet tall by 10 feet wide. You can distribute the plates in any way you choose within range.</p>
            <p class="indent">The plates are perfect squares and can be placed in any position (horizontal or vertical). Any adjacent slabs merge with each other, and each plate can act as a foundation for another, allowing for continuous constructions in any direction, such as bridges or ramps, as long as at least one of the plates is anchored to the earth to be stable.</p>
            <p class="indent">A plate cannot occupy the space of a creature or object. If a plate appears in a location occupied by a creature, it is pushed to any side of your choice. If you try to trap a creature between the plates, the creature can make a Dexterity saving throw and position itself outside on a success.</p>
            <p class="indent">Each plate has an AC of 16 and 180 hit points, disappearing magically if reduced to 0, possibly causing the collapse of adjacent plates at the GM’s discretion.</p>
            <p class="indent">As a bonus action, you can dispense the plates at any time during the spell. If you maintain concentration for the entire duration of the spell, you can choose to keep the plates permanently, but they will turn into plates of slightly greenish rock, without any value other than stone. If you choose not to keep the plates permanently or lose concentration before the end of the spell, the plates disappear magically without a trace.</p>

            <p>When you cast this spell, a flame that rises from your feet covers your entire body, increasing your speed and strength momentarily. As part of this spell, you can immediately move 40 feet in any direction you choose. During this movement, you can push objects up to five times your normal capacity (or 150 times your Strength score in pounds). If you collide with a creature, the movement ends, and the creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 40 feet back and fall prone. If the creature’s movement is interrupted by obstacles, it will fall prone and suffer 4d6 bludgeoning damage in addition. If the path is blocked by another creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, suffering the same damage and falling prone on a failure.</p>

The creature must understand you to be affected, and if it does, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration.

            <p>Circles of hot and dry winds surround the target of the spell, creating a strong wind area with a 10ft radius around them, granting them a +2 bonus to AC and imposing disadvantage on ranged attack rolls made against them. Hostile creatures that start their turn or enter the area must make a strength saving throw or be pushed out of the area on a failed save.</p>
            <p class="indent">During their turn, the target of the spell can use a bonus action to make a magical ranged attack against a creature within 30ft. If the attack hits, it deals 1d12 bludgeoning damage, and the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they are pushed back 20ft and fall prone; on a success, they are pushed back 10ft and remain standing. If there is an obstacle in the way of the pushed creature, they take 2d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10ft they are pushed, and if the obstacle is another creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take the same damage and also fall prone.</p>
            <p class="indent">In addition, if a creature is targeted by an attack and the attacker or the target is within 30ft of the area of this spell, the target can use their reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack by sending a gust of wind towards it.</p>

The DC of the Wisdom checks is equal to your spell save DC. For each failure, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage from small cave-ins in the tunnels. A minotaur or other creature with the Labyrinthine Recall ability automatically succeeds on this check.</p>

            <p>When you touch a silk scarf to a wall of rock or earth, you create a shelter for up to eight people. The entrance marked by the scarf can only be seen by those you designate and is invisible to others. Inside the shelter it is dry, has a comfortable climate, and a small crystal provides illumination that can be turned on or off with a word from anyone chosen. At the end of the spell, you can cast it again to maintain the same shelter, otherwise the spell ends. You can use an action to end the spell at any time, and when the spell ends, the void created fills and expels anything inside it out of the wall. The volume of rock in the wall must be compatible with the size of the shelter created, otherwise the spell fails.</p>
            <p class="indent">Elemental Flux. You can imbue your elemental flow into the entrance, so that once during the duration of the spell, when an undesired person enters the earth shelter, they must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 5d6 acid damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one.</p>

A creature whose movement is impeded by obstructed spaces, such as walls or objects two size categories larger, takes 1d6 damage for every 10 feet it moved before having its movement impeded. If you choose to have the wind blow against the ground or a creature that cannot move due to a wall or other obstructed space caused by large or larger objects, a creature that fails the saving throw is knocked prone and restrained until the beginning of its next turn.</p>

On a failure, for the duration of the spell, the creature becomes frenzied and will always attack its nearest creature.

            <p>You point the gem at a creature you can see within range and cast a fiery-looking ray from your forehead, which pierces through obstacles and reaches the creature’s mind. The creature must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a success, the creature falls unconscious and wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature uses an action to wake it. On a failure, the creature’s Intelligence and Wisdom are reduced to 1. The affected creature can’t cast spells, activate magic items, understand language, or communicate in any intelligible way, but it can still identify its friends, follow them, and protect them.

            <p>You attempt to create magical, non-burning chains around the limbs of a creature of your choice that you can see within range. It must make a Wisdom saving throw, and if it fails, the shackles form and it will be charmed for the duration. If an ally or friendly creature is fighting against the target, it has advantage on the saving throw.</p>
            <p class="indent">While the chains remain on the target, you have telepathic communication with it and always know where it is, even on another plane, and it will obey your commands to the best of its ability. You can give commands of simple courses of action, such as attacking a target or running in a direction, as a free action. If you want to give an order of a sentence length, you must use a bonus action. If the creature completes the action and receives no new commands, it will use the action to defend and preserve itself as best as it can.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you or one of your allies deals damage to the creature, it may repeat the saving throw, ending the spell on a success.</p>

It must make a Wisdom saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is charmed by you until the spell ends or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The charmed creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance.

            <p>You manipulate the earth, opening a fissure within range, starting at a point you can see. The fissure occupies a line 50 feet long and 10 feet wide. Within the line, a chasm opens up to a depth of 20 feet, and creatures within the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they fall into the chasm. The terrain inside the fissure is considered difficult, and its walls are sandy, making any Strength (Athletics) check to climb it to be rolled against your Spell Save DC</p>
            <p class="indent">Starting at your next turn, you can close the fissure as an action. Creatures still inside it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 6d12 force damage on a failure, or half as much on a success. Until the start of your next turn after closing the fissure, it is not fully sealed, and a creature trapped inside the fissure has total cover but is restrained and can use their action to make a Strength saving throw. On a success, they can use their full movement to try to climb out, ending the condition when they leave the fissure, but for every 1 foot of movement required, they must spend an additional 1 foot, emerging in an adjacent space to the fissure if the movement is sufficient. On a failure, they cannot move. At the start of the next turn after the fissure is closed, it is fully sealed, and all creatures still inside it are incapacitated and have their movement reduced to 0. Creatures with burrowing movement are immune to the effects of closing the fissure. The fissure closes automatically at the end of the spell or if you lose concentration.</p>
            <p class="indent">Elemental Flux. With your next elemental surge, you stomp the ground. All creatures in a 20-foot radius circle centered on you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 10d6 bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.</p>

            <p>You ignite your spirit with flames, emitting an aura that generates adoration or fear in a specific type of creature around you. You choose a type of intelligent creature as the target of this spell, and all of those within range are affected according to the chosen aura as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent">Frightful Aura. This aura causes the chosen creatures within range to feel fear. Each creature of the chosen type that starts its turn or enters the aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for the duration of the spell. A creature that succeeds the saving throw is immune to the effect for 1 minute. While frightened, the creature uses its movement to reach the safest place possible where it cannot see you and is out of range. When it is out of range and can no longer see you, the creature is no longer frightened. If the creature re-enters the range or can see you again, it becomes frightened once more. Whenever a creature takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>
            <p class="indent">Adoration Aura. This aura causes all chosen creatures within range to adore you as a revered entity. Each creature of the chosen type that starts its turn or enters the aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the spell’s duration. A creature that succeeds the saving throw is immune to the effect for 1 minute. A charmed creature approaches you as closely as possible and will adore you in the best way its culture or customs would venerate a figure of respect, as determined by the GM. Whenever a creature can no longer see you and is more than 60 feet awayfrom you, it is free from the effect, but will become affected again if it sees you or is within 60 feet of you once more. If a creature takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>

            <p>All creatures you choose within the spell’s range and that can see you must make a Charisma saving throw. A target automatically succeeds the saving throw if it is immune to the frightened condition. On a failure, the target is affected by the spell. Until the end of the spell’s duration, you can, as a bonus action, specify a location that is not occupied by a creature where the creatures will believe that blazing flames are erupting, emitting extreme heat. At the start of their turns, each affected target within 30 feet of the chosen point must move away from the heat source at all its speed before taking any other actions. A creature that is forced to move by this effect may repeat the saving throw at the end of its turn, freeing itself from the effect on a success. A creature that does not move for any reason remains frightened until it moves away. A creature will not walk to a location that is obviously a mortal danger, such as a cliff, but it may provoke opportunity attacks during its movements.</p>

Once during the spell’s duration, you can give a one-word simple command to a creature within 60 feet, which must make a Wisdom saving throw, following the command on a failure. The command has no effect if the target is undead, if it doesn’t understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it. After following the command, all other effects of the spell end. Some typical commands andtheir effects follow. You might issue a command other than one described here. If you do so, the GM determines how the target behaves. If the target can’t follow your command, the spell ends.</p>
            <p class="indent">Approach. The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.</p>
            <p class="indent">Drop.The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.</p>
            <p class="indent">Flee.The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means.</p>
            <p class="indent">Grovel. The target falls prone and then ends its turn.</p>
            <p class="indent">Halt. The target doesn’t move and takes no actions. A flying creature stays aloft, provided that it is able to do so. If it must move to stay aloft, it flies the minimum distance needed to remain in the air.</p>
            <p class="indent">At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 4th-level spell slot or higher, for the duration of the spell, you gain an extra use of the command for every 2 slot levels above 2nd that you use. The bonus to ability checks granted by this spell only ends when the last use of the command is used.</p>
            <p class="indent">Elemental Flux. Your next elemental surge deals 2d6 fire damage plus 1d6 fire damage for each slot level above 2nd.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 5-foot cube. This image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. Only one chosen creature can sense this image and it seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can’t create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature.</p>
            <p class="indent">As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.</p>
            <p class="indent">Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.</p>
            <p class="indent">At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring your concentration.</p>

            <p>Upon casting this spell, your eyes glow with an eerie light. At the start of each of your turns, you may choose any number of creatures you can see. Each one must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you. A creature frightened in this way must use its actions to move as far away from you as possible via the safest available route, unless it can’t move. If it moves to a spot that is at least 60 feet away from you, it is no longer frightened. If the creature can’t move, it must make another Wisdom saving throw at the end of its turn. On a failed save, it falls unconscious until it takes damage or until someone uses an action to awake it. A creature that was already frightened by this spell and is targeted again, it makes the saving throw with advantage.</p>

If you choose a surface that conceals the glyph, the spell will not take effect. The glyph is apparent and bright and clearly magical. While you cast the spell, you must set a trigger that you desire for the glyph’s effect, such as touching or stepping on the glyph or the approach of a certain type of creature within 5 feet of it</p>
            <p class="indent">When the glyph is activated, choose one of the following effects:</p>
            <p class="indent">Disintegration. The glyph destroys the object or location where it was placed, heating it to the point of disintegrating everything within a 10-foot radius around it. A creature that touches the object or is in the area being disintegrated must make a Constitution saving throw, reducing its hit points to 0 and turning to dust on a failure or taking 6d8 radiant damage and 6d8 fire damage on a success.</p>
            <p class="indent">Self-Destruction. The glyph self-destructs in a powerful explosion. All creatures within a 60-foot radius must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 40d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
            <p class="indent">Eternal Heat. The glyph emits a lot of heat. For the next 1001 days, any creature that starts its turn or enters a space within 30 feet of the glyph takes 4d8 fire damage, and creatures that are beyond these 30 feet but within 60 feet of the  glyph must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 2d8 fire damage on a failure.</p>
            <p class="indent">Elemental Flux. Your next elemental surge affects a 45-foot cone and deals 14d6 fire damage.</p>

If a creature’s hit points drop to 0 as a result of the swap, that creature falls unconscious and begins dying.</p>
            <p class="indent">In addition to the hit point swap, the two creatures can choose to exchange any of the following effects, provided both creatures agree:</p>
            <p class="indent">Condition Swap. Choose one of the following conditions: blinded, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned, or stunned. If one of the creatures is currently affected by the chosen condition, that creature is cured of the condition and the other creature becomes affected by it. This exchange lasts until the spell ends, at which point the conditions return to the originally affected creature.</p>
            <p class="indent">Skill Swap. The two creatures choose one skill, tool, or language proficiency each and exchange the chosen proficiency for the duration of the spell.</p>
            <p class="indent">At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration of the condition swap and skill swap increases by 1 extra hour for each slot level above 3rd.</p>

            <p class="indent">Each round, the first creature or object that enters one end of the tunnel becomes an invisible and silent electrical charge that instantly travels through the tunnel to the other end, reforming in its original form. Creatures and objects that pass through the sides of the tunnel take no damage and are unaffected by the spell.</p>
            <p class="indent">d are unaffected by the spell. However, when a creature is transported through the tunnel, any other creatures standing inside the tunnel’s area take 2d6 lightning damage as the energy arcs through them. This damage has no visible source, and creatures that are transported through the tunnel are immune to it.</p>
            <p class="indent">At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the length of the tunnel increases by 30 feet and the diameter increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 3rd.</p>
            <p class="indent">Elemental Flux. Your next elemental surge affects a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide and deals 5d6 acid damage plus 1d6 acid damage for each slot level above 3rd.</p>

            <p>You create a barrier that looks like a net of pure energy. The barrier does not need to be sustained and can float in the air. It occupies an area of 60 feet in length, 20 feet in height, and one inch in thickness. Any creature within the area where the barrier was created must make a Strength saving throw, suffering 3d8 lightning damage on a failure and being thrown 10 feet in a direction of your choice. On a successful save, the target takes only half the damage and is expelled into the nearest free space, as chosen by the affected creature.</p>
            <p class="indent">The barrier magnetically affects an area of 15 feet around it. Inside this area, attacks made with metal weapons have disadvantage, and creatures made of metal or wearing metal armor move at half speed (moving 1 foot costs 2 feet of speed).</p>

            <p>You encase a touched creature with a barrier of lava, shielding it from attacks. For the duration, the creature is resistant to fire and cold damage. If the creature takes bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage from a creature adjacent to it, the barrier spews lava at the attacking creature, which must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 3d8 fire damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">Optionally, the creature protected by the barrier can take a reaction upon being hit by a melee attack to make the barrier explode, causing every creature within 15 feet, except itself, to make a Dexterity saving throw.

            <p class="indent">While the spell is active, you can sense the location of the object as long as it is within 240 feet of you, even if it is behind walls, doors, or other barriers. The location is communicated to you as a general sense of direction (e.g., “northwest”) and distance (e.g., “close”, “very far”).</p>

            <p>You choose the stat block of a non-spellcaster creature with a CR of up to 12, then you create a dense air replica of that creature, within an unoccupied space that you can see within the spell’s range. The replica uses all the statistics of the creature it duplicates, except that any damage dealt by the replica is psychic damage. However, the replica can only damage or affect in other ways creatures that failed the saving throw. It acts on its own turn and on its own initiative, but you can control its course of action. If the replica’s hit points are reduced to 0, the spell ends, and it immediately dissipates.</p>

            <p>You manipulate earth and rocks to create objects within range. If using fresh earth (sand, clay, and general soils), you can create a large or smaller object (contained within a 10-foot cube, or eight connected 5-foot cubes), such as statues, bridges, passages, pillars, doors, etc., as long as there is enough earth to do so. If using metal or solid rock, .you can create only a medium or smaller object (contained within a single 5-foot cube), such as a weapon, idol, crown, etc. The objects are usually solid, without gears or hinges, and generally of good quality. However, the quality of objects, such as jewelry, statues, or any that require artistic or professional knowledge, may vary depending on your proficiency or the availability of the right tools.</p>
            <p class="indent">At Higher Levels. When you use a spell slot of 5th or 6th level, you can make a huge object of fresh earth (contained within a 15-foot cube, or twenty seven connected 5-foot cubes) or a large object of solid material (contained within a 10-foot cube, or eight connected 5-foot cubes). When you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can mold a gargantuan object of fresh earth (contained within a 20-foot cube, or four connected 10-foot cubes, or sixty-four connected 5-foot cubes).</p>

            <p>You touch a non-magical object weighing no more than 5 pounds, causing its surface to become reflective like a mirror. During the spell’s duration, the object captures all images and sounds within a 30-foot radius, as long as they are reflected on its mirrored surface.</p>
            <p class="indent">When the spell ends, the object reverts to its original state, and the captured images and sounds are retained, hidden within it. To access the captured images and sounds, the object must be submerged in any body of water large enough to completely cover it. Once the object is submerged, the captured images and sounds are displayed on the surface of the water and can be viewed as if you were on the location. The size of the water surface determines the size of the image, with a larger surface allowing for more details to be seen.</p>
            <p class="indent">The object can store the captured images and sounds for up to 1 year. However, once the object is submerged and the images and sounds are accessed, or if it is removed from the water before the end of it, the information is lost and cannot be recovered.</p>
            <p class="indent">The quality of the captured images and sounds depends on the quality of the object used as a mirror. Polished and well-maintained objects capture clearer and sharper images and sounds, while dirty and worn objects can produce blurred and distorted images and sounds.</p>
            <p class="indent">At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the weight limit of the object increases by 5 pounds for each slot level above 2nd.</p>

A creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw, becoming paralyzed on a failure. On a successful save, the creature’s nervous system is fatigued and on its next turn, it cannot use one of its actions, be it an action, bonus action, or movement. A paralyzed creature can make another saving throw at the end of its turns, ending the condition on a success but still being affected by the action restriction on its next turn. If your concentration is broken, paralyzed creatures are released but still suffer from the action restriction. A creature that has passed the action restriction is freed from the effects of the spell.</p>

            <p>You touch a non-magical object weighing up to 10 pounds, causing it to briefly glow with an earthy light before splitting into a number of identical copies equal to twice your proficiency bonus (minimum of 4). Each copy has the same appearance, weight, and physical properties as the original object, including any markings or inscriptions.</p>
            <p class="indent">However, the copies created by his spell bear an unnatural aura that makes them immediately identifiable as magical constructs to anyone who inspects them closely. As a result, it is very difficult to use these copies to deceive others or pass them off as genuine items.</p>
            <p class="indent">The copies created by this spell last for 1 hour or until they are destroyed, at which point they crumble into a pile of dust. You can end the spell prematurely by using a bonus action to cause one or more copies to disappear.</p>
            <p class="indent">The copies created by this spell are mundane objects and do not possess any magical properties. Additionally, they cannot be used to create copies of items made of precious metals or gems, as their unique physical properties cannot be replicated by this spell.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You transform a 30-foot-radius circular area, centered on a point within range, into quicksand. The area becomes difficult terrain and every creature within it at the time of casting, or that starts its turn or enters the area, must make a Strength saving throw. On the first failure, the creature begins to sink in the sand and becomes restrained. On the second failure, the restrained creature sinks even further, becoming incapacitated. On a third failure, the incapacitated creature sinks completely into the sand and becomes stunned. Each time a creature succeeds on a Strength saving throw, it regresses one step in the number of failures, becoming unburied if it reaches 0 failures.</p>
            <p class="indent">A creature that is completely buried by this spell cannot breathe, is under total cover, has disadvantage on Strength saving throws, and suffers 3d10 bludgeoning damage for each failure it has on Strength saving throws. Failures beyond the third are added to the number of failures.</p>
            <p class="indent">Another creature that is adjacent to a buried creature and is not under any effect of the spell can use an action to help dig out the buried creature. The creature must make a Strength ability check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees the creature from the spell’s effects, but on a failure, it is pulled into the area of effect and counts as having failed a Strength saving throw against the spell. A creature within the area of effect that tries to help another does so with disadvantage on the Strength check.</p>
            <p class="indent">When the spell ends, all creatures that are restrained suffer 3d10 bludgeoning damage, all creatures that are incapacitated suffer 6d10 bludgeoning damage, and all creatures that are stunned suffer 10d10 bludgeoning damage. Objects and creatures that are dead or die from the final damage remain buried, while surviving creatures are expelled from the ground.</p>
            <p class="indent">Objects that are not being held are automatically buried, and structures within the area suffer 30 bludgeoning damage when the spell is cast, and at the beginning of each turn that you maintain the spell.</p>
            <p class="indent">Elemental Flux. With your next elemental surge, you stomp the ground. All creatures in a 30-foot-radius circle centered on you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, taking 14d6 bludgeoning damage and being knocked prone on a failed save. Each creature within the quicksand area that is hit by this elemental surge fails in the saving throw automatically, counting as a failure for the spell too.</p>

            <p>You touch a body or a body part that still exists of a creature that has been dead for no more than 500 years. The part of the creature and any material components turn into a seed that automatically sprouts into a plant, generating a bulb where the body of the creature is recreated and restored. After 8 hours, the bulb opens, and the creature is revived, healed of all wounds, any poisons removed, all diseases cured, and freed from any curses that afflicted it when it died. The spell fully restores the body, replacing missing parts.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the body of the creature no longer exists, the casting time doubles, and you must speak the creature’s name, take an object that belonged to it, and, as part of this spell, bring its spirit, which will be mixed with the material components when forming the seed. If the spirit is not available, the spell fails, and no components are expended.</p>
            <p class="indent">The spell can even provide a new body if the original no longer exists. The creature then appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 5 feet of the plant.</p>
            <p class="indent">Elemental Flux. Your next elemental surge, instead of dealing damage, imbues the creature’s body with an elemental soul, leaving it immune to diseases and curses for a number of days equal to 10d6 days.</p>

            <p>You harness a sacred water flow to reverse a loss of life in a body, resurrecting the creature. The creature cannot have been dead for more than 100 years, cannot be an undead or construct, must have a soul available for return to the body, and cannot have died of old age.</p>
            <p class="indent">At the end of the spell, the target creature returns to life with all wounds healed, regaining any lost limbs and free of any conditions, but it receives 4 levels of exhaustion. Additionally, the resurrected creature returns free of any non-magical diseases or curses. Magical diseases and curses will resume their effects if they are not removed beforehand.</p>
            <p class="indent">The flow of magic is very heavy and until a long rest is finished, you will receive two levels of exhaustion and have a -4 reduction to all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.</p>
            <p class="indent">Elemental Flux. With your next elemental surge, you imbue the creature targeted by this spell and yourself with elemental energy, granting both 6d8 temporary hit points that last for 10 hours.</p>

At the time of casting and at the beginning of each turn of a creature within the area, they must make a Dexterity saving throw, becoming prone on a failure.

            <p class="indent">In addition, at the GM’s choice, other effects may occur, such as fissures or shifting ground. When a fissure is formed, it can have a depth of 3d4x10 feet and a width of 1d4x5 feet. Creatures in the area of the fissure must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they fall into the fissure, or choose one of the edges to remain on the surface on a success. When the ground shifts, at the GM’s discretion, a block bounded by a straight line may rise or sink 1d4x10 feet, taking everything on it along and causing structures it cuts through to collapse.</p>

            <p>You expel all the air from a 30-foot radius sphere centered on a point within range, and the area remains airless for the duration. All creatures within the area at the time of casting who require air to breathe must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they suffer one level of exhaustion, as the air is sucked out of their lungs.</p>
            <p class="indent">Furthermore, creatures inside the sphere are subject to the normal rules for suffocation. They can hold their breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + their Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds), and then survive a number of rounds equal to their Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round) before they drop to 0 hit points and begin dying.</p>
            <p class="indent">In addition, the airless area becomes difficult terrain for the duration of the spell, and any creature that starts its turn within the area or moves into it on its turn must make a Constitution saving throw, suffering one level of exhaustion on a failed save. Creatures within the area are considered deafened, and no sound can propagate within it.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, creatures inside the sphere are immune to thunder damage, and no thunder damage can be caused inside the sphere.</p>
            <p class="indent">At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 5th.</p>

            <p>You and up to five other willing creatures within range take a step on the border of the Ethereal Plane, entering the region that overlaps with the current plane. While on the border, you can move in any direction as if you had a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can still see and hear the original plane, but everything appears grayed out and muffled, and you can’t see anything beyond 60 feet.</p>
            <p class="indent">For the duration, as a bonus action, a creature under the effect can choose to move from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane and vice versa. The creature returns to the same mirrored location it occupied in the Ethereal or Material Plane (if returning to the Material Plane in midair and without a fly speed, the creature will fall).</p>
            <p class="indent">While on the Ethereal Plane, you can only affect and be affected by other creatures on that plane. Creatures not on the Ethereal Plane cannot perceive you or interact with you, unless a special ability or magic has given them the ability to do so.</p>

            <p class="indent">When the spell ends, you and your allies return to the plane of origin in the same location you occupied at the time. If you occupy the same space as a solid object or creature when this happens, you will immediately be moved to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you were moved.</p>

            <p>You touch a creature, causing a collection of stones to gather and form an arm of stone that connects with the target’s torso. The stone hand can hold and manipulate objects just like a regular hand, but it is not capable of attacking or performing somatic components for spells.</p>

            <ul>

                <li>The target can use the third hand to manipulate objects that would normally require the use of both hands, such as picking a lock or disarming a trap. If using three hands, the target gains advantage on any Dexterity checks made to interact with objects in this way.</li>
                <li>The target can use the third hand to retrieve or stow an object that is normally out of reach, such as a potion on a high shelf or a weapon on the ground. The hand can reach up to 10 feet away from the target and can manipulate objects weighing up to 5 pounds. It must still use the appropriate action to do so.</li>
                <li>The target can use the third hand to perform simple tasks, such as carrying a torch, holding a door open, or carrying a small object while using both of its regular hands for something else.</li>

No sound passes through the wall, and those inside cannot see anything outside the sphere.

It can support any amount of weight inside or on top of it and weighs around 1000 pounds, plus the weight of what is inside.

            <p>You manipulate the mind of a creature within range, subtly influencing their emotions and behaviors. Choose one effect from the following list to apply to the target:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Aversion: The target develops a strong aversion to a creature or object of your choice, becoming slightly nauseous by its presence and avoiding it when possible.</li>
                <li>Change Mood: You can influence the person’s mood, causing them to feel overall happy, angry, sad, or agitated, affecting their behavior accordingly. This will not force a creature to attack or stop a combat, but will influence its overall mood.</li>
                <li>Attraction: The target feels a strong attraction to a creature or object of your choice, seeking to approach and interact with it in a non-threatening manner. This effect does not end combat, but may make the target less likely to harm or kill the object of their attraction, while doing so does not endanger itself.</li>
                <li>Anger: The target feels anger toward a creature or object of your choice, seeking to harm it or break it. In combat, if an enemy is chosen, the target may make this enemy a preferred target. The creature will not attack or do anything that would be against its principles or would endanger itself.</li>
                <li>The target must make a Wisdom saving throw to resist the spell’s effect. If the target fails the saving throw, they are affected by the chosen effect for the spell’s duration.</li>

            <p>During the spell duration, you can use a Bonus Action to analyze an area within 60 feet of you, detecting any blood drops, small objects, and weapons within the area. Once you have detected blood drops, make a Wisdom (Investigation) check to determine what you have uncovered. You learn the following information based on the results of your check:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>10 or more: You determine if any creature spilled blood and how many there are and their types.</li>

            <p>You unleash a burst of bubbles in a 30-foot wide, 80-foot long line, affecting all enemies within. Creatures in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw or be engulfed in a bubble. Once trapped, a creature is considered underwater, incapacitated, and vulnerable to lightning damage. Its movement speed is reduced to 0, except for swimming. At the start of each of its turns, the trapped creature can make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice). On a successful save, it is no longer incapacitated but remains trapped inside the bubble. A creature can escape the bubble by destroying it. Each bubble has an AC of 17 and 30 hit points, is immune to bludgeoning, fire, lightning, poison, acid, and cold damage, and has resistance to non-magical slashing and piercing damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">Creatures outside the bubble can attack it, but if the attacker is Huge or smaller and uses a melee attack, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the attacking creature becomes trapped in another bubble that emerges from the first.</p>

The spell affects a circular area of land with a half-mile radius and 100 feet in thickness, lifting the block of land, including everything it carries above it, and an equal volume of earth below it.</p>
            <p class="indent">Once in motion, the block moves 30 feet per turn, uninterruptedly in the last commanded direction. With a bonus action, you can make the block start moving, change the direction of movement, or stop it.</p>

You can create a block of earth that levitates permanently by casting the spell on the same block of earth for a year and on the last day defining a creature that will receive an atonement with it that will have control over its movement without needing to concentrate. If the creature dies or is willing, you can change the attuned creature with a new casting of this spell.</p>

            <p>You create a volcano from a point on the ground within range. From the moment you cast the spell, a volcano begins to rise from the ground, growing in four distinct stages. Each round you maintain concentration on this spell, it produces additional effects of the next stage.</p>
            <p class="indent">First stage. When you cast the spell, a 20-foot-radius sphere around the point you choose becomes extremely hot, and the ground becomes scorching hot. Creatures that enter or start their turn within the area must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 6d8 fire damage on a failure or half as much on a success.</p>
            <p class="indent">Second stage. The ground within the area of the first stage rises, transforming the area into difficult terrain and beginning to release toxic gasses. All creatures within the area and a further 20-foot radius must make a Constitution saving throw or become poisoned due to the toxic gasses. Additionally, the effects of the first stage increase to a 40-foot radius.</p>
            <p class="indent">Third stage. The raised area explodes in lava, and all creatures in the 20-foot-radius sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take 8d8 bludgeoning damage and 3d8 fire damage, are thrown 20 feet in the opposite direction, and become coated in lava. A creature coated in lava takes 8d8 fire damage at the start of each of its turns for the next minute, or until it is doused with 3 gallons of water or uses an action to clean itself. In addition, the area affected by the second stage increases to a further 20-foot radius, and the area affected by the first stage increases to a total of a 60-foot radius.</p>
            <p class="indent">Fourth stage. A 20-foot-radius pool of lava forms at the center of the volcano, rising to a height of 40 feet and beginning to launch magma spheres into the surrounding area. The magma spheres strike three locations of your choice within 100 feet of the center and affect a 10-foot-radius circle. Creatures in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 10d8 fire damage and become coated in lava on a failed save, or half as much damage and no coating on a successful save. Buildings within the affected area are destroyed, with the extent of the damage determined by the GM.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you lose concentration on the spell, the volcano retreats, returning one stage per round, and ending after it retreats from the first stage.</p>
            <p class="indent">Elemental Flux. Your next elemental surge affects a sphere of a 30-foot radius centered on you. All creatures in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 14d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>

            <p>You use water to neutralize spells. With an action, you can target a creature, an object, or a magical effect within range. Any spell of 3rd level or lower on the target ends. Each spell of 4th level or higher requires you to make a Wisdom ability check (DC 10 + spell level), ending the spell on a success.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you cast this spell as a reaction, you can interrupt the casting of a spell, but you must still make the Wisdom ability check regardless of the spell’s level, with disadvantage.</p>
            <p class="indent">At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 4th-level spell slot or higher, you automatically end spells of up to the same level as the slot used. When cast as a reaction, you gain a +2 bonus to the Wisdom ability check for each slot level above 3rd.</p>
            <p class="indent">Elemental Flux. Your next elemental surge deals 5d6 cold damage plus 1d6 cold damage for each slot level above 3rd.</p>

            <p>You sprinkle ruby dust over the flames, causing a barrier of pure magma to rise from the ground. You can choose the shape of the barrier to be either a straight line with a length of 60 feet, a height of 15 feet, and a width of 5 feet, or a circle with a diameter of 20 feet, a height of 15 feet, and a width of 5 feet. The barrier blocks the line of sight.</p>
            <p class="indent">When the barrier appears, every creature within its area is pushed to one side of it, as chosen by you, and must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d8 fire damage and being covered in lava on a failure, or taking half damage and not being covered in lava on a success.</p>
            <p class="indent">A creature that is covered in lava takes 2d8 fire damage at the end of each of its turns until it is either doused in at least 3 gallons of water or takes an action to clean itself.</p>
            <p class="indent">A creature can move through the barrier, but it is a painful and slow process. For every 1 foot moved, the creature must spend an additional 4 feet of movement. A creature that chooses to cross becomes covered in lava and must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 6d8 fire damage on a failure or half as much damage on a success.</p>

            <p>You create a translucent barrier at a point within range, for the duration. The barrier floats in the air and does not require support, appearing in any position you choose, either horizontal, vertical, or angled. It has a thickness of 1 inch and you can make it semi-spherical or spherical with a radius of up to 15 feet, or flat, creating up to ten panels of 10-fot by 10-foot, which must be contiguous. If the barrier appears in a creature’s space that cannot pass through it (see below), the creature is pushed to one side of your choice.</p>
            <p class="indent">When creating the barrier, you can set one creature type or alignment (good, evil, chaotic, lawful) that cannot pass through the barrier. All other creatures or alignments can pass through it normally, but the chosen type cannot pass hrough the barrier in any way. Attacks and spells of the chosen creature type are neutralized by the barrier, which is indestructible for them, even affecting the Ethereal Plane. A creature that is not of the chosen type can choose not to pass through the barrier, so it can walk on the barrier as if it were solid ground, but once it does, it cannot go back on that decision.</p>

            <p class="indent">When you cast the spell, you can choose to accelerate the aging process of the targeted creature or object by a factor of twenty, causing it to experience twenty times the normal effects of the passage of time. For example, you could cause a plant to grow to maturity in a matter of hours, accelerate the onset of a poison to take effect within seconds instead of minutes, or end a magical effect with a minimum duration of one minute instantly. This spell can age a touched creature or object by 20 days in one. If the target is a creature, it can make a Constitution saving throw to avoid this spell’s effect on a success.</p>
            <p class="indent">Note that the spell only affects natural and mystical processes related to time, and does not affect the actions or abilities of the target. The spell can be used to affect a wide range of effects related to time, but the GM should determine the limits of the spell’s effects and the potential consequences of using it in creative ways.</p>

            <p>You create a whirlwind at a location of your choice. The point remains stationary for the duration. Whenever a creature other than you comes within 5 feet of it, that creature must make a Strength saving throw or be flung away in the direction established by you when the spell was cast. The creature is thrown 40 feet high and 20 feet away in that direction.</p>
