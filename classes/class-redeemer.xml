        <description>
            <p>Redeemers are divine spellcasters chosen by the gods, using energy rays to heal or harm. Guided by prophetic dreams, they possess unique charisma and influence to inspire others. They purify negative emotions, bestow blessings and are embodiments of Tamera and Bauron’s duality.</p>
            <h4>THE REDEEMER</h4>
            <p>Across the vast eons of Tanares, redeemers have served as divine emissaries of the celestial deities Tamera and Bauron, bestowed with divine magic and exceptional charisma. Endowed with a natural ability to move mortal hearts, they develop a plethora of skills, individually guided by their prophetic dreams and visions of destiny. Bound by their divine calling, redeemers tread a unique path, interpreting and sharing their revelations of the gods’ will, which grants them profound insights into the world.</p>
            <p class="indent">Amidst the spreading darkness of the Ungods’ corruption, redeemers emerge as spiritual beacons, wielding their divine gifts to cleanse objects tainted by mortal sins and malevolent desires. In doing so, they turn these once-corrupted items into wellsprings of sacred power, banishing the influence of the Ungods and gaining power to give their blessings upon those in need.</p>
            <p class="indent">As visionaries of unrivaled allure, redeemers shepherd their followers, inspiring unwavering faith in their divine guidance. Skilled in the arts of negotiation, trade, and leadership, they serve as revered advisors and orators, their celestial blessings from both Tamera and Bauron granting them a harmonious perspective on the world and the wisdom to find balance between extremes.</p>
            <p class="indent">Though their convictions may diverge from established doctrines and from each other, most redeemers remain united by their divine purpose. Their liberty of belief extends even to those who renounce the gods, embracing twisted philosophies to justify their actions. Yet, their divine powers remain undiminished, stirring fervent discourse within the halls of the Celestianist Church regarding their sacred nature.</p>
            <p class="indent">As prophets and visionaries, redeemers effortlessly draw adherents to their cause, forming tight-knit circles of devout believers. With their vast array of divine spells and their innate ability to perceive the emotions of others, they become sought after by those yearning for spiritual guidance and divine intervention.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A REDEEMER</h4>
            <p>The first step to creating your redeemer is to define their personal beliefs. While their power originates from the gods, it’s important to consider what they believe the gods want from them and any prophetic dreams they may have had. Not all redeemers know precisely where their powers come from; they simply know that they are fueled by gold and other emotion-infused material goods. By defining your redeemer’s beliefs, you can map out the discourse they will adopt — one of divine salvation or personal fulfillment, for example.</p>
            <p class="indent">Once you have established your redeemer’s beliefs, consider what they do with the gold they receive. Do they use their powers to help people in the best way possible, fulfilling their desires? Or do they move from town to town, collecting gold from the desperate and becoming rich? Do they view other redeemers as competitors or potential allies who can help them solve people’s problems?</p>
            <p class="indent">Finally, it’s important to define what led your character into the life of adventure. Were they seeking an easier way to obtain gold and artifacts? Did they have a divine dream that drove them to adventure? Are they looking for protection by being part of a team, or do they want to gather an army to prepare for the Armageddon? Perhaps they seek to spread the word of the gods to as many people as possible. Whatever the case, understanding your redeemer’s motivations and beliefs will help you create a rich and engaging character for your campaign.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You have been blessed by the gods who have granted you divine powers, so that you are capable of casting cleric spells.</p>
            <h4>Cantrips</h4>
            <p>You know four cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Redeemer Spells Known column of the Redeemer table.</p>
            <h4>Spell Slots</h4>
            <p>The redeemer table shows how many spell slots of 1st level and higher you have available to cast spells. To cast one of these spells, you must spend a spell slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all spent spell slots when you complete a long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent">For example, if you want to cast the 1st-level spell bless and you have one 1st-level spell slot and one 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast bless using either spell slot.</p>
            <h4>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h4>
            <p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the cleric spell list. The Spells Known column of the Redeemer table shows when you learn more cleric spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For example, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one cleric spell you know and replace it with another spell from the cleric spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
            <h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>
            <p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells, since the power of your magic depends on your ability to project the divine magic within you into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
            <center>
                <p><strong>Spell save DC</strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier </p>
                <p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
            </center>
            <h4>Ritual casting</h4>
            <p>You can cast any cleric spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag in its description.</p>
            <h4>Spell Focus</h4>
            <p>You can use any gold coin as a focus for your cleric spells.</p>
        </description>
        <sheet>
            <description>You can cast cleric spells as rituals. You can prepare {{redeemer:spellcasting:prepare}} spells from the cleric spell list. You can use a holy symbol as your spellcasting focus.</description>

        <description>
            <p>As a redeemer, your greatest weapons are your rays, which shoot directly from your hands. Starting at 1st level, you can fire a Positive or Negative ray using your action, as long as you have at least one free hand. Your rays have a range of 60 feet and must target a single creature.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Positive Ray.</strong> Must target a willing creature. Grants 1d4 temporary hit points, which last for 1 minute. Note that temporary hit points don’t stack, but instead replace each other, as per the general rule for temporary hit points.</p>
            <p class="indent">The temporary hit points granted by the ray change to 2d4 at 5th level in this class, 3d4 at 11th level, and 4d4 at 17th level.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Negative Ray.</strong> Make a ranged spell attack against the target creature, dealing 1d6 necrotic damage on a hit. This damage ignores any immunity or resistance the creature has if it’s an unnatural creature. In Tanares, unnatural creatures are those not created by Tamera and/or Bauron, such as penumbral creatures, Ungods, undead, and aberrations. If you’re playing in another setting, talk to your GM to decide what types of creatures fit this definition.</p>
            <p class="indent">The damage caused by your ray changes to 2d6 at 5th level in this class, 3d6 at 11th level, and 4d6 at 17th level.</p>
