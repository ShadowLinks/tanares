        <description>
            <p>Scoundrels are simplified rogues. They are ideal for new players who are looking for less complexity or to create a more straightforward character without sacrificing effectiveness during play.</p>
            <h4>Scoundrel</h4>
            <p>Scoundrels are the very embodiment of cunning and guile, renowned for their mischie vous tricks and underhanded dealings. Theirsharp minds and silver tongues deceive with effortless charm, beguiling those around them and manipulating their adversaries to their advantage. With a love for the shadows and a disdain for fame, they are driven by wealth, adventure, or personal causes.</p>
            <p class="indent">Life on the street has honed the scoundrels into fiercely independent and cynical individuals, with a soul tempered by the harsh realities of survival. They learned to be acrobatic and agile, exploiting the weaknesses of their enemies and delivering devastating blows to their critical points with precision and speed. Wielding light weapons like daggers, they rely on speed and agility over brute force, moving with fluid grace that leaves their foes disoriented and struggling to keep up.</p>
            <p class="indent">In combat, scoundrels are the ultimate thieves and tricksters, leaving a trail of confusion in their wake. Their cunning, swiftness, and ability to strike from unexpected angles make them formidable opponents, cementing their reputation as masters of the shadows. With a carefree exterior and a quick wit, they are both dangerous and unpredictable, making them a valuable asset to any adventure group. But with their love for wealth and tendency to be motivated by personal gain, they can also be lucky yet unreliable allies. Scoundrels are survivors of the street, and their skills are the result of a lifetime of mischief, sly, and crafty schemes.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can’t multiclass into Simplified Classes, or multiclass if you are a Simplified Class.</p>
            <h4>How to play with a Scoundrel</h4>
            <p>The scoundrel class is a superior pick for players seeking to excel in stealth, disarming traps, unlocking doors, and employing a quick and cunning combat style. As a scoundrel, you’ll enjoy a unique suite of skills, honed to razor-sharp efficiency as you level up, establishing you as a formidable stealth combatant capable of delivering potent damage and evading even the most intricate traps.</p>
            <p class="indent">At 1st level, your combat prowess is enhanced by the Sneak Attack Simplified feature. This power allows you to deal extra damage when attacking an enemy adjacent to an ally. This additional damage escalates as you progress in levels. Moreover, the Scoundrel’s Agility feature facilitates your movement across the battlefield without provoking opportunity attacks, making you a master of the hit-andrun combat strategy.</p>
            <p class="indent">This class encourages strategic combat, taking advantage of positioning and allied placements to strike enemies where it hurts most. You might find yourself using the infamous “backstab” tactic often, making scoundrels excellent battlefield tacticians.</p>
            <p class="indent">As you advance in levels, your problem-solving prowess becomes increasingly prominent. The Adventurer’s Aptitude and Experience features give you a bonus to ability checks and additional proficiencies, making you a versatile asset in many situations. Your inherent agility is further enhanced by the Evasion feature, ensuring your safety in dangerous situations.</p>
            <p class="indent">The Precise Striker feature significantly improves the accuracy of your attacks, reinforcing the scoundrel’s reputation as a deadly and efficient combatant.</p>
            <p class="indent">In a nutshell, the scoundrel class offers a comprehensive gaming experience, granting you numerous benefits in stealth, skill proficiencies, and the ability to escape challenging situations unscathed. As a scoundrel, you’ll find yourself perfectly equipped to handle everything from stealth missions to enemy mage fireballs. Pairing with complementary classes in your adventuring party can further enhance the strengths of this versatile class.</p>
