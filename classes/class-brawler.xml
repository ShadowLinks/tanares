        <description>
            <p>Brawlers are simplified barbarians. They are ideal for new players who are looking for less complexity or to create a more straightforward character without sacrificing effectiveness during play</p>
            <h4>Brawler</h4>
            <p>Brawlers are warriors from remote tribal communities renowned for their immense strength and unwavering spirit. Drawing on a connection to the earth and their ancestral heritage, they harness a primal power that fuels their ferocity in combat. Unlike traditional barbarians, brawlers don’t rely on rage, but rather on their raw physicality and brute strength to overcome any obstacle.</p>
            <p class="indent">Armed with massive two-handed weapons, they unleash devastating blows on their foes, leaving a trail of destruction. Although fearsome, most brawlers have good hearts and hold their tribe and elders in high regard. Proud of their heritage, they will go to great lengths to protect or bring honor to their people. Brawlers often join adventurers to make a name for themselves and defend their tribes from harm. With their indomitable spirit and earth-shattering strength, they are a formidable presence on the battlefield, leaving their mark and making their tribe proud.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can’t multiclass into Simplified Classes, or multiclass if you are a Simplified Class.</p>
            <h4>How to play with a Brawler</h4>
            <p>The brawler class is an excellent choice for players who want to excel in the combats they and their allies will be engaged in, either dealing massive amounts of damage or resisting the damage that would be inflicted on their allies</p>
            <p class="indent">As a stripped-down version of a barbarian, brawlers possess a unique set of combat-focused skills that become increasingly powerful as they level up, making them some of the best melee combatants in the entire game.</p>
            <p class="indent">At level one, brawlers’ ability to withstand damage surpasses that of any other class, making them incredibly difficult to take down in a fight.</p>
            <p class="indent">This allows for a more aggressive approach to combat tactics, as combatants have a greater chance of surviving and emerging victorious from any altercation. Thus, brawlers make excellent tanks or brutes.</p>
            <p class="indent">As brawlers level up, they gain access to a variety of skills that further increase their ability to deal damage (Extra Attack and Deadly features), accuracy (Hit the Mark feature), and mobility (Powerful Legs feature). This allows them to take down enemies more efficiently while maintaining their consistency, reliability and power in terms of damage, as well as being able to better deal with ranged attacks such as from archers and/or spellcasters.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, the Resilient feature amplifies their resilience to punishment, making them even harder to take down in combat, granting bonuses to the Constitution saving throws they must make.</p>
            <p class="indent">It’s worth noting that while brawlers are incredibly proficient in combat, they’re not limited to that aspect of the game. The Experience feature allows players to gain experience in areas beyond combat, allowing them to create more well-rounded characters.</p>
            <p class="indent">For example, players can choose to develop soft skills such as Deception, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion, or opt for intellectual skills such as Arcana, History, and Religion. By doing so, they can improve their characters’ playability without interfering with their strength or resilience.</p>
            <p class="indent">In summary, the brawler class offers players a unique playstyle that allows them to excel in combat, while also providing the opportunity to develop skills beyond the battlefield. With the right mix of skills and abilities, brawlers can become a formidable force in any gaming scenario.</p>
