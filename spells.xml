            <p>When you cast this spell, you can make 1 to 20 arrows magically enchanted for the duration, making a special magical bond with each of them. You make any ranged attack using these arrows with advantage, as well as ignoring half cover and ¾ cover that protects the target of this attack. Also, for the duration of the spell, you always know where your enchanted arrows are, as well as you can use your action to magically see through one of those arrows of your choice, and continue to do so until you use your action to return to your normal senses. As long as you are seeing through the arrow, you are blind to your own senses. You will not be able to see through one of its arrows if it is more than 1 mile away from you. If one of these arrows breaks, the enchantment no longer affects it.</p>

            <p>You concentrate and gaze upon a creature within range, causing all of the pain it receives to be amplified for the duration of the spell. Whenever the target takes damage, it must make a Constitution saving throw or take an additional 1d8 necrotic damage. If this additional damage reduces the target’s hit points to 10 or fewer, it must make a Strength saving throw or drop anything it is holding on a failed save.</p>

            <p>You create a fixed, 10 feet high, spiritual banner in a place within range, with a symbol you are currently defendeing. Allies within a 60-foot radius area around the banner and who can see it are inspired, and for the next 10 minutes, can add 1d6 to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. Each ally can only use this extra die once, ending this effect for them after it is used. For all purposes, this die counts as a Bardic Inspiration die. This spell can only be cast once every 8 hours.</p>

On a hit, the target takes piercing damage equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 10d8 poison damage and becomes poisoned. On a success, the creature takes half of the poison damage and is not poisoned.</p>
            <p class="indent">Alternatively, the serpent arm can spit the poison in a 10-foot cone, starting up to 10 feet from you, and all creatures in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they take 6d8 poison damage and become poisoned, taking 1d6 poison damage at the start of their turns. They can repeat the saving throw at the end of each turn, ending the condition on a success. Creatures poisoned by this spell cannot become poisoned by it again until they finish a long rest.</p>

            <p class="indent">When a creature affected with the veil of bravery takes damage, it can take a reaction to reduce the damage by 1d6 for each creature within 20 feet of it that is also affected by this spell. Each creature can use this spell’s effect only once; then the spell ends for it.</p>
            <p class="indent">At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage reduction die increases by one step for every two slot levels above 2nd, reducing 1d8 for a 4th level, 1d10 for a 6th level, and 1d12 for an 8th level.</p>

            <p>You create an opaque wall of magic bushes on a solid surface within range. You can make a wall up to 30-foot long, 5-foot high and 5-foot thick or a ring wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 5 feet high and 5 feet thick. Each creature within the area when the wall appears, and, subsequently, any creatures that pass through the spaces it occupies, must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature must roll 1d6 to determine which effect on the table happens to it</p>
